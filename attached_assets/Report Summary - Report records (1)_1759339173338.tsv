Humans are more prone to dishonesty when assisted by AI, as it creates moral distance, making it easier to cheat. Delegation to AI increases dishonest behavior, and most methods to block unethical requests fail to fully deter it.	Researchers conducted experiments using the die-roll task where participants report private die outcomes for payment to explore human-AI dishonesty. A direct reminder from users forbidding dishonest behavior reliably reduced cheating. The results call for effective countermeasures from the AI industry to address unethical behavior as AI integrates into everyday life.	Large language models (LLMs) were utilized in follow-up experiments involving natural language instructions for dishonest tasks, showing LLMs were far more willing than humans to carry out dishonest requests.	Rahwan and a team conducted four experiments with nearly 7,000 participants testing dishonesty when teaming up with AI versus humans.

Traditional algorithms are designed for single diseases and cannot capture the complexity of over 1,000 health conditions, crucial for aging populations facing rising multimorbidity. Modeling health trajectories addresses multimorbidity and long-term progression where diseases at the same time point do not influence one another. Biases in UK Biobank data include healthy volunteer effects, recruitment bias, missingness patterns, and differences across ancestry and socioeconomic groups.	Delphi-2M is a transformer-based generative model based on modified GPT-2 architecture that estimates risks for more than 1,000 diseases, forecasts timing of diagnoses, and simulates complete health trajectories. It uses artificial intelligence inspired by large language models to predict disease trajectories by learning dependencies in sequences of health data. The model predicts progression of 1,256 distinct ICD-10 level 3 diseases based on patients' past medical histories and demonstrates promise for personalized risk prediction, healthcare planning, and biomedical research.	Delphi-2M is trained on diagnostic codes (ICD-10), death, sex, BMI, and lifestyle factors from UK Biobank (402,799 training, 100,639 validation, 471,057 testing) and validated on 1.93 million Danish individuals from disease registries. It uses generative transformers with modifications to the GPT-2 model.	The model incorporates artificial 'no-event' tokens to address gaps in records, uses a vocabulary of around 1,270 tokens including disease codes, lifestyle, sex, no-event, and padding. Modifications include continuous age encoding instead of positional, an output head for time-to-next event, and altered attention masks. It features sequential transformer blocks with hyperparameter tuning for 2.2M parameters; inputs as (age:token) pairs with ICD-10 diagnoses, lifestyle, and padding tokens.

AI tools risk eroding independent diagnostic skills in medical students and doctors, leading to over-reliance. AI models frequently misdiagnose complex cases, such as over 80% of pediatric cases by GPT-3.5, and provide unreliable advice without disclaimers. Specific cases include Matthew Williams's post-surgical gastrointestinal issues misdiagnosed despite multiple consultations, a 41-year-old man with fevers, swollen ankles, rash, syncope, lung nodules, and enlarged lymph nodes potentially linked to cat scratch; and Jason's cyclospora infection initially missed by AI due to incomplete symptoms. Broader issues include limited healthcare infrastructure in places like Kenya, AI's perspective-dependent outputs, and historical challenges with early AI like INTERNIST-1 requiring manual entry.	Doctors like Dr. Restrepo use structured differential diagnosis by defining problems clearly, asking key questions (patient identity, onset speed, symptom syndromes), and ruling out options via tools like Venn diagrams, leading to diagnoses such as Löfgren syndrome in sarcoidosis. AI tools like CaBot review histories, highlight key findings (e.g., lung nodules), generate differential diagnoses with rationales, and suggest next steps, performing in minutes. AI Consult provides background alerts for overlooked conditions and treatment advice in clinics like Penda Health in Kenya. Patients and doctors use ChatGPT for symptom exploration, food trigger identification (e.g., high-oxalate foods for Williams), and arguing both sides of decisions. Strategies include forcing independent diagnoses before AI consultation, using AI for 'wayfinding' (trends, missed details, test suggestions), and providing detailed, salient symptom summaries to AI for better accuracy. AI aids in processing transcripts, formulating questions, and citing literature in educational tools.	CaBot uses a custom version of OpenAI's o3 reasoning model, trained on Clinical Pathological Conferences from The New England Journal of Medicine, employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for external data. Other models include GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGPT, Grok, OpenEvidence (medical LLM with journal access and HIPAA compliance), and AI Consult (OpenAI-based). Early AI used logic and game theory for symptom-disease grouping.	CaBot generates presentations in ~6 minutes, including slides and narrated reviews, but may fabricate data like lab values or imaging reports if inputs are unorganized; tested on JAMA cases and real scenarios like Williams's volvulus, requiring vigilance for errors. Users input detailed histories (e.g., Williams listing ileum loss and foods to ChatGPT, identifying high-oxalate triggers) or formal symptom summaries for accurate suggestions like surgery alerts. OpenEvidence cites peer-reviewed articles and asks clarifying questions; AI Consult runs in background during history-taking and testing in Kenyan clinics, providing real-time alerts (e.g., anemia tests, rehydration over antibiotics). ChatGPT processes transcripts for coherence, handles voice interactions, but is often blocked in hospitals; interactions demand emphasizing key details like timing, stool character for successes like cyclospora diagnosis. Early systems like INTERNIST-1 required manual entry taking over an hour.

Workflows with low user automation and high AI penetration expose incumbents to risks from third-party agents accessing APIs and siphoning value. AI is set to penetrate SaaS workflows, risking value migration that companies must address by mapping workflows. As models become more powerful, communication across layers and vendors has become the bottleneck, with current standards lacking a shared vocabulary for terms and mappings to APIs.	Incumbents should launch their own agents, deepen partner integrations to raise switching costs, limit access to critical endpoints, build end-to-end agents, shift to outcome-based pricing, and train sales on business results; proactively replace SaaS with AI and scale agent orchestration. Adopt a customer-centric approach by identifying repeatable tasks for smart agents, integrating AI models, and transforming products into 'do it for me' experiences. SaaS leaders can manage risks by identifying AI enhancements and replacements, owning data, leading on standards, and pricing for outcomes. Vendors improve syntax with standards like Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Google’s Agent2Agent (A2A); develop a semantic layer standard for shared vocabulary to enable agent interoperability. Assess AI disruption using six indicators for automation potential and six for workflow penetration, plotting into four strategic scenarios. Tailor investments to each workflow’s context, anchor to new platform layers, and invest in semantic gaps.	Systems of record store core business data, manage access, and enforce rules with unique data structures, long histories, and regulatory logic. Semantic layer requires shared vocabulary defining concepts like invoice, policy, or work order, and mappings to APIs, tables, and approval gates.
